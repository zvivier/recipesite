    <h2>Why Takeout?</h2>
    <b>Takeout lets you support your local businesses, enjoy delicious food you may otherwise struggle to make, and experience new cultures!
    <h2>How to order?</h2>
    <b>You may be tempted to pick up the phone and order something simple, a safe go-to. Maybe the pizza place across the way, or chinese. However, I'd recommend branching out, maybe trying something new!</b>

    <p>Note that DoorDash is expensive, and probably doesn't pay their fair share. I'd recommend using it to get ideas, then going on the company website or calling them up!</p>
